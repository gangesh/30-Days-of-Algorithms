# 30-Days-of-Algorithms
Studying one algorithm per day for 30 days to strengthen my programming skills.

## Background
I got my university degree in graphic design. I didn't start coding until I was 28. I do not have a background in computer science, and I've always felt self-conscious about that. Until recently, it had never directly impacted my career. 

I recently did not make it past a first-round coding challenge because my code was "too complex". I went online to see if I could find evidence to prove the reviewer wrong. What I discovered very quickly is, "SHE WAS RIGHT".  I was really hurt and disappointed in myself, but I am not one to navel-gaze for long. I decided to see it as a challenge and learning experience. 

To strengthen my understanding of the most common and most useful algorithms, I decided to pick one algorithm every day for 30 days and learn how to use it effectively and to commit it to memory. 

Life being what it is - which is to say unpredictable and hectic - I may not post an alogirthm every single day, but I will post one "for" every day. For instance, today I am posting the first 3 days. Some days I may not have time to post one but I will make up for any missed days.

I will not only add each algorithm here but will post each one as a public gist. feel free to join the discussion on the gists.

## The Algoritms

1. [Day 01 - Euclid's Algorithm](src/01-euclids-gcd-algorithm.js)
1. [Day 02 - Find Missing Number 1 ... N](src/02-find-missing-number-1-to-n.js)
1. [Day 03 - Find Missing Number 0 ... N](src/03-find-missing-number-0-to-n.js)
